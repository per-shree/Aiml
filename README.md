# Aiml

A collection of AI/ML experiments and practical scripts organized as project files `P1` through `P8`.

## Overview

This workspace contains multiple project scripts that explore different machine learning and data science topics, such as:

- text classification and natural language processing
- signal processing and vibration analysis
- face recognition and computer vision
- stock market prediction and financial analytics
- classification using classic ML algorithms
- energy demand forecasting
- predictive maintenance simulation
- custom neural network demonstrations

## Practical Descriptions

- `P1` — SMS Spam Detection
  - Loads the SMS Spam Collection dataset and converts labels into numerical form.
  - Uses `TfidfVectorizer` to transform message text into features.
  - Trains a `MultinomialNB` classifier and evaluates accuracy on a held-out test split.
  - Visualizes ham/spam distribution and the top spam-indicating words.
  - Demonstrates predictions on example messages.

- `P2` — Engine Vibration Analysis
  - Reads engine sensor data from a CSV file.
  - Applies FFT to compute the frequency spectrum of vibration signals.
  - Compares healthy, unbalanced, and misaligned engine signatures.
  - Uses RMS value thresholds to classify engine condition.
  - Plots the time-domain signal, frequency spectrum, and comparison chart.

- `P3` — Face Recognition with Random Forest
  - Loads the Olivetti faces dataset or a local `.npy` file of face images.
  - Converts grayscale images to BGR and extracts histogram-based features.
  - Trains a `RandomForestClassifier` to recognize individuals.
  - Evaluates classification accuracy and shows example predictions with images.

- `P4` — Stock Market Movement Prediction
  - Loads stock price data and computes technical indicators such as moving averages and RSI.
  - Sets a binary target for whether the next day's closing price increases.
  - Trains a logistic regression model on scaled financial features.
  - Outputs model accuracy, the confusion matrix, and an ROC curve.

- `P5` — Flower Classification with KNN
  - Loads an Iris-style flower dataset from CSV.
  - Explores the dataset with pair plots and basic summary statistics.
  - Trains a `KNeighborsClassifier` to predict flower type.
  - Evaluates accuracy and displays a confusion matrix.
  - Includes a sample flower measurement prediction.

- `P6` — Energy Demand Forecasting
  - Reads hourly energy demand data from a CSV file.
  - Converts timestamps to numeric hour values and fits a linear regression model.
  - Predicts future electricity demand for specified hours.
  - Visualizes actual data, regression fit, and predicted demand points.

- `P7` — Machine Maintenance Simulation
  - Loads machine failure data and simulates a maintenance process using a Markov chain.
  - Defines state transition probabilities between working and failed states.
 - Generates a state history over time and animates the transition plot.
  - Demonstrates a simple predictive maintenance concept with visualization.

- `P8` — Neural Network Demonstration
  - Implements a small two-layer neural network with random initial weights.
  - Trains on synthetic regression data and explores simple control behavior.
  - Plots model predictions for grades, control targets, and a process fit.
  - Demonstrates how a neural network can learn relationships from generated data.
